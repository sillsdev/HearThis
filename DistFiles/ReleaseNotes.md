# Scroll down for Release Notes

# Getting Started
To use HearThis to record audio Scriptures, you will need the following:
1. A default recording and playback device capable of high-quality audio. Set up a
	headset microphone and (probably) an external A/D USB converter.
	Reportedly some laptops can do an OK recording job right out of the microphone
	jack, so if you can't locate an external convert, please do some experimenting
	anyways.
2. A Paratext project or Digital Bible Library "text release bundle" with some translated Scripture.
3. One or more speakers of the language to record the Scriptures. Once a project is
	selected and a few (optional) settings are selected to meet the needs of the project,
	HearThis is intended to be usable by people with minimal computer skills and relatively
	little training. Users should be taught to navigate to the text that is to be recorded,
	record each script item, check the recordings, and re-record as necessary. After they
	get the basics, please teach them to use the keyboard, not the mouse (which is
	inefficient for such a repetitive task). Please take note of their reading fluency;
	a large proportion of the intended audience will struggle to read naturally, and that's
	why the interface is designed to make it easy to listen and re-record, as many times as
	necessary.
4. If you have problems, suggestions or PR-Letter fodder, please email issues@hearthis.palaso.org


# What to Back Up
HearThis stores a separate WAV file for each script line, indefinetly.
When you "Export", it gathers these up, joins them into chapters, and then
converts them to the format you choose.   The individual WAV files are
stored in the Program Data folder, under the SIL\HearThis directory.  For
example, on Windows 7, Genesis chapter 1 of the Good News UK would be stored
here: <a href="file:///C:/ProgramData/SIL/HearThis/GNTUK/Genesis/1">
C:\ProgramData\SIL\HearThis\GNTUK\Genesis\1</a>. This location needs to be
backed up (a future version of MyWorkSafe will do that automatically). If for
some reason you need to get at these files, for example to delete them or run
some audio cleanup process over them, feel free to do so.

#Notes on Exporting

To export to mp3 format, you'll need to download something extra. MP3 is still under
patented in the USA, at least through 2017. We are not lawyers, but based on messages with the patent owner's representative, our understanding is that if you are making less than US$100,000 per year related to the distribution of these mp3s (including web page advertising, etc.), then you have no worries. Since everything done with HearThis is normally free, it's unlikely this will effect anyone. If you install "<a
	href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&amp;item=lame-mp3">LAME
for Audacity</a>", then HearThis will use it to create MP3s. This format is also needed for export to Saber devices.

#Notes on MegaVoice

MegaVoice uses small "tag" recordings to help the user navigate by audio.
This version of HearThis does not yet generate those files.  MegaVoice also
requires a particular bit/rate for its wav files (16bit, 44.1k, mono). HearThis does convert
the recorded files to that format, if necessary.

# Release Notes

## 1.3 May 2016
* Right to left languages now align to the right in the main window. HearThis gets this setting from Paratext.

## 1.2 February 2016

* New "Record Line in Parts" dialog allows readers who are having trouble with a line to split a long line into two separate recordings.
* Now remembers window size and position between runs.
* Fixed: Now remembers font size
* The shortcut key for "play" has been changed from "." or "Enter" to only TAB. Removing "." is motivated by user reports of accidentally pressing "space" (record) when they meant to press "." (play). Removing "Enter" is needed to keep the normal Windows convention of "Enter" meaning "accept and close" on dialogs. If you try to use ".", you get a reminder that it has moved to "TAB".

## 1.1 9 July 2015
* HearThis project can now be based on a <a href="http://digitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/entryref/text/index.html">
text release bundle</a> rather than a Paratext project.
* You can also now just point at a Paratext Project folder and have HearThis use it, even if Paratext is not installed.
* Therefore HearThis can now run with no Paratext installed.

# What's New in Version 1.1
