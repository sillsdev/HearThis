# Developers

## Getting dependencies

1. Ensure you have something that can run bash scripts
1. Run build/get-dependencies.sh
1. Ensure you have [Nuget](http://nuget.codeplex.com/) installed
1. Building the solution should automatically pull down the nuget dependencies.
1. Assemblies not available on the build server or via nuget are checked in to the rep lib/dotnet. When working on the code, the development team needs to decide if any of these assemblies should be replaced with the latest version. Normally lib/dotnet/ParatextShared.dll will be updated to the latest version.

## Continuous Build System

Each time code is checked in, an automatic build begins on our [TeamCity build server](http://build.palaso.org/project.html?projectId=project16&tab=projectOverview), running all the unit tests. Similarly, when there is a new version of some HearThis dependency (e.g. LibPalaso, LocalizationManager), that server automatically rebuilds HearThis. This automatic build doesn't publish a new installer, however. That kind of build is launched manually, by pressing a button on the TeamCity page.  This "publish" process builds HearThis, makes and installer, rsyncs it to the distribution server, and writes out a a json file that the downloads page reads so that it can display options to the user.

## Coding Standards

Please avoid making spurious white space changes. HearThis uses tabs, not spaces, for indentation.
